                <h3>Practical Based Learning</h3>
                <p>Practice based learning takes place during placements which involve a range of learning opportunities for student development. Students apply and consolidate their learning, bringing together academic theory, workplace practice to develop skills and competences needed to register.</p>

                <h3>Experienced Facilitators</h3>
                <p>A facilitator (or a Workshopper, as we like to call them!) is the person who guides a team through a process, helping them unleash their potential, do their best work, and avoid the usual pitfalls of collaboration: groupthink, a lack of outcomes, and team politics (to name just a few!)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Ultra Modern Teaching</h3>
                <p>The teaching method which focuses more on teaching the students for improving their intellect behavior by using various new and innovative ideas rather than making them recite the syllabus to clear the examination with the same old style is Modern Teaching Methods in simple words.</p>
