        <h3>CAD/CAM Programme</h3>
        <p>CAD stands for Computer-Aided Design and CAM stands for
           Computer-Aided Manufacturing, both of which are used to 
           make things. CAD/CAM software is used to design and manufacture
            prototypes, finished products, and production runs of products.

      <h3>Graphic Design Programme</h3>
      <p>Graphic design is a craft where professionals create visual content 
        to communicate messages. By applying visual hierarchy and page layout 
        techniques, designers use typography and pictures to meet users' specific
         needs and focus on the logic of displaying elements in interactive designs,
        to optimize the user experience.</p>

    <h3>Annimation</h3>
    <p>Animation is a method by which still figures are manipulated to appear as
       moving images. In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand 
       on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film. Today,
        many animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI).</p>
